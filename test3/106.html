	  <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>The Problem</h3>
      <p>For  more than 300 years, publishing articles in scholarly journals has been the  surest way to ensure that research is made available and read.&nbsp;&nbsp; Authors  contribute the products of their research to journals, usually without  compensation.&nbsp; Publishers manage  important services such as the peer-review process, filtering, production, and  distribution.&nbsp; Their services are paid  for through a combination of page charges and subscription fees.&nbsp; The latter has the deleterious effect of  limiting access to a work, but it has been the only way to ensure that  publication and distribution would occur.&nbsp;  Universities have subsidized much of the cost of scholarly publication  by supporting researchers who contribute research papers and editorial and  peer-review services.&nbsp; Universities also  subscribed to the journals, thus making them available to a broader audience  and minimizing the constraints on distribution that subscriptions inevitably impose.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>The  traditional model of scholarly communication is breaking down.&nbsp; The explosion in the number of published  papers and journals means that no single library can reasonably hope to  subscribe to all relevant literature.&nbsp; As a result, the ability of  researchers to have their articles read and to read relevant literature is declining.&nbsp; Furthermore, the prices of many journals have  become exorbitant, increasing at rates far above the rate of inflation.&nbsp; And while the cost of accessing scholarly articles  is increasing, interest in providing access to that research in poorer areas of  the world has also increased.&nbsp; </p>
      <h3><strong>Digital </strong><strong>to the Rescue</strong></h3>
      <p>Fortunately,  the emergence of digital means of communication holds the promise of reshaping  the traditional subscription-based model for research distribution.&nbsp; Cornell University Library is conducting numerous <a href="http://library.cornell.edu/scholarlycomm/affordable/">experiments</a> to test whether digital technologies can broaden access to scholarly literature  or lower its cost.&nbsp; </p>
      <h3><strong>Open-Access  Publishing</strong></h3>
      <p>Open-access  scholarly journals have arisen as an alternative to traditional subscription  scholarly journals. Open-access journals make their articles freely available to everyone while providing services  common to all scholarly journals, such as the peer-review process, production, and  distribution. Since open-access journals do not charge subscription or other  access fees, they must cover their operating expenses through other  sources.&nbsp; This has included foundation  support, subventions, in-kind support, and, in a sizable minority of cases,  processing fees paid on behalf of authors.&nbsp; </p>
      <h3><strong>The Compact for  Open-Access Publishing Equity</strong></h3>
      <p>The <a href="http://www.oacompact.org/">Compact for Open-Access Publishing Equity</a> is an  experiment whose participants &mdash; currently Dartmouth, Harvard, 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of  California at Berkeley and Cornell &mdash; pledge to underwrite reasonable  publication charges for articles written by their faculty and published in  fee-based open-access journals when other funding sources are not available.&nbsp; The compact recognizes that publishers add  value and seeks to minimize the financial risks to publishers willing to move  to a fee-based open-access model. </p>
      <h3><strong>Be an Advocate</strong></h3>
      <p>If  you believe that publishing in open-access journals in order to provide  unfettered access to your research is important, please let us know. We are  looking for researchers who will encourage others to publish their work in this manner.<strong> </strong></p>
