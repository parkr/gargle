<P><font size="+2" color="#b31b1b">About Collection Development at Cornell University</font>



<P>Collection Development, the shaping and management of library materials
within the confines of available resources,  is a recently-evolved
specialization in libraries.  The comprehensive <em>Encyclopedia of Library and
Information</em> (1968-1984) does not list the term within its thirty-five
volumes.  Yet in the past two decades most research libraries have identified staff to
carry out the collection development canon: budgeting, selection (and
withdrawal), collection evaluation, and policy formation.

<P>At Cornell the formal establishment of collection development dates from
1977 when the Library began a Project for Collection Development and
Management, funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.[1]  The Project's
impetus resulted in the appointment of a senior administrator charged specifically with
setting policy within the endowed library units and a department of
specialists, bibliographers, who, with their colleagues in the college and
department libraries and curators in the Special Collections, make day-to-day
decisions on the composition of the collections.  With modifications, that
model remains in place today.  

<P>Currently an Associate University Librarian administers collection
development while the day-to-day decisions are
made by the bibliographers, curators, and selectors listed at another location
within this document. [<em>To view the list, select the underlined <A
HREF="http://www.library
.cornell.edu/colldev/cdselectors1.html">area</A>.</em>]  To enhance coordination, librarians with collection development responsibilities
are grouped into four teams: area, humanities, sciences, and social sciences. 
One member of each team joins a representative of the statutory libraries, the
Acquisitions Librarian,  and the Head Bibliographer to consult with and advise
the Associate University Librarian on the Collection Development Executive Committee.
