History<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p><strong>Clientele:</strong> <br>
The Department of History offers courses on all historical periods of
German-speaking Europe, emphasizing social, intellectual, and cultural
history.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The study of almost any aspect
of European history necessarily includes consideration of Germanic Europe,
given its central location and importance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Several courses are cross-listed with the Department of German Studies,
whose interests include the historical milieu of literary figures and
works.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The Institute for European
Studies and the Institute for German Cultural Studies both encourage the
research and study of topics supported by the North European history
collection. </p>

  <p><strong>Existing Collection ECS:</strong> 4/W <br>
Austrian, Swiss, Low Country and Scandinavian history is held and collected at
a 3 level, but German history is a solid 4. The Library maintains standing
orders for many monographic series, some of which are long-run titles from
local historical societies. Other strengths: the Thirty Years' War, the history
of Prussia, the unification of the German states, the history of the
Austro-Hungarian Empire, and twentieth-century history. </p>

  <p><strong>Current Collecting CCI:</strong> 4/W <br>
Existing collection strengths are supported to the extent possible.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>North European archaeology is supported
primarily by standing orders, with few monographs selected in addition.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>(Prehistoric and Classical archaeology are
covered by other bibliographers.) Efforts have been made recently to acquire as
much as possible about the reunification of Germany and its aftermath, life in
the DDR, and cultural and social history and policy.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>The Early Modern Period, the Enlightenment, and the Weimar period
are emphasized, as are German historiography, and material about Germans
outside the boundaries of German-speaking Europe (German-Americans are covered
by the American History Bibliographer), as well as material classed in history
about foreigners within Germany.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Holocaust studies are covered in coordination with the History
Bibliographer and the Jewish Studies Bibliographer.</p>
