        <p align="left"><strong>Framing the topic:<br />
              </strong>For many years,
                the cost of scholarly serials&#8212; 
                paper and electronic&#8212;has outstripped both indicators of
                inflation and university budgets. Statistics collected by the
                <a href="http://www.arl.org/stats/arlstat/graphs/2003/monser03.pdf" target="_blank">Association
                of Research Libraries</a>
                (PDF) show that between 1986 and 2003, a period in which the
                Consumer Price Index grew 68% and the average monograph purchased
                by members of the association 82%, serial unit costs grew a whopping
                215%. During this same period, the amount of scholarly publication
                increased markedly, serial titles by 138%. The result of these
                trends is that research libraries in North America are spending
                ever more money for ever fewer publications. We are now reaching
                the point where many institutions, including Cornell, are no
                longer able to provide access to some standard materials needed
                for instruction and research.</p>
              <p align="left">There are three major reasons for the rise in serials 
                expenditures. The first, and best known, is the growing influence 
                of commercial firms in scholarly publishing, especially that segment 
                of the industry dedicated to science, technology and the social 
                sciences. Commercial publishers charge more for their information 
                than scholarly societies or university presses. </p>
              <p align="left">Second, the costs of publishing in traditional
                form  are increasing to a point that in some disciplines it is
                becoming  ever more difficult for scholarship to be published
                in a timely  and useful fashion. The Modern Language Association&#8217;s
                ad hoc Committee on the Future of Scholarly Publishing provides
                an excellent <a href="http://www.mla.org/pdf/schlrlypblshng.pdf" target="_blank">overview</a> (PDF).</p>
              <p align="left">Finally, the need for research libraries to purchase 
                materials in paper and electronic formats provides additional impulse 
                to rising serials expenditures. The substantial advantages of electronic 
                materials (especially in ease of access and text manipulation) are 
                of unquestionable value to scholars, and Cornell, like all major 
                research libraries, is investing heavily in its digital holdings. 
                At the same time, however, we must still purchase traditional materials 
                since they continue to be the principle medium of information exchange 
                in some fields. We are likely to remain in this state of transition 
                from paper to digits for some years to come, and this will be very 
                costly.              </p>

                  <p align="left"><strong>The impact 
                  at Cornell:</strong></p>
                  <p align="left"> Cornell University Library statistics document trends 
                  similar to those reported by the Association of Research Libraries. 
                  Materials budgets on the Ithaca campus increased 185.5% between 
                  1986 and 2004, but the number of serial titles purchased increased 
                  only 5%. The contract college libraries, despite materials budget 
                  increases of 120% since 1988, actually subscribe to 14% fewer serial 
                  titles than they did at the beginning of the period. </p>
                  <p align="left">The most visible impact of rising prices at Cornell 
                  is cancellation of expensive journal titles. See the <a href="http://www.library.cornell.edu/scholarlycomm/elsevier_canc2.html">list</a> 
                  of journals published by Elsevier that were cancelled in 2004. </p>

              <p align="left">But in the long run, only a fundamental change in
                 the modes of scholarly communication will meaningfully address
                rising  serial costs. That change has begun. Informed in part by
                an education  campaign emanating from the Library, Cornell&#8217;s
                Faculty Senate  passed a <a href="http://www.library.cornell.edu/scholarlycomm/resolution2.htm">resolution</a> that &#8220;&#8230;supports the library&#8217;s efforts to bring
                 serials costs under control while at the same time maintaining
                the  collection&#8217;s quality.&#8221;\
                As one promising way of sponsoring change in publishing fundamentals,
                 the Library has actively encouraged the Open Access Initiative&#8217;s
                  efforts in scholarly e-publishing, covered in detail on <a href="../openaccess/action.html">this
               site</a>. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="content">
              <p align="left"><strong>What Faculty can Do:</strong></p>
              <p align="left">The Cornell faculty has responded through the public 
                support expressed in the <a href="http://www.library.cornell.edu/scholarlycomm/resolution2.htm">Faculty 
              Senate resolution</a> and through many private gestures.</p>
              <p align="left">Faculty can help develop methods that will allow us 
                to rely far less heavily on commercial publications. This can be 
                done in part by working with scholarly societies and university 
                presses to ensure that they are able to publish quality scholarship 
              at reasonable prices.</p>
              <p align="left">Also, methods presently used for the exchange of scholarly 
                information in individual disciplines need to be reviewed, and practicable 
                alternatives developed and considered. Several initiatives are now 
                underway to study or facilitate scholarly communication. See these 
                selected <a href="../affordable/index.html#alternative">links for 
              alternative publishing options</a><font color="#FF0000"><font color="#000000">.</font></font></p>
              <p align="left">Third, scholars need to retain some rights to their 
                own work, rather than signing them over completely to publishers. 
                When submitting materials for publication, Cornell scholars should 
                consider stipulating at the very least that their publications be 
                freely available to the Cornell community for purposes of instruction 
                and research. Preferably scholars should also negotiate to ensure 
                that they retain the right to post their own publication on their 
                own or on their institutions Web sites. More information is available
