<H2>Iberian Language and Literature</H2>

<P><B>Clientele:</B> 
<br>The primary clientele for the collection is the faculty and students of the Romance Studies and Modern Languages and Linguistics Departments.  Others using the collections include members of the Department of Comparative Literature and the Latin American Studies Program.

<P><B>Existing Collections:</B> ECS 3+(Spanish) 2 (Portuguese)  Language W

<P>Spanish collections are strong in all areas of the major chronological periods of the literary canon: Medieval, Golden Age, and Modern; Portuguese collections developed less intensively.  Language and Linguistics collections strong on grammars and dictionaries as well as analytic studies, again with Spanish-language emphasis.

<P><B>Current Collecting:</B> CCI 3+ (Spanish) 2 (Portuguese)   Language W

<P>Current collecting in language and literature follows the traditional emphases outlined above for the existing collections, with both primary texts and secondary studies acquired.  Texts in Catalan, Basque, Gallego, and other non-Castillian languages of Iberia purchased very selectively. The major national periodical titles in these subjects are represented in the collection.

<P><B>Subjects Covered:</B> LC classes PQ 6001-7000 (Spanish Language and Literature), PQ 9000-9400 (Portuguese Language and Literature).

<P><B>Geographical Information:</B> 
<br>There are no geographical limitations on this collection, but as a matter of fact most materials are published in Iberia, Latin America, Western Europe, and the United States.

<P><B>Exclusions: </B>textbooks, newspapers, rare items, manuscript materials.

<P><I>Notes:</I> The Ibero-American Bibliographer collaborates on the development of collections that cover the Hispanic and Portuguese speaking worlds as a whole, e.g. comparative works, colonial literature.
