<H2><P>Linguistics</H2>


<P><B>Clientele:</B>

<br>The study of linguistics, the systematic study of human speech, is found at this time within the Department of Modern Languages and Linguistics.  Twenty-four faculty offer courses in most of the major subfields of linguistics: phonetics and phonology, syntax, semantics, historical linguistics, sociolinguistics, and applied linguistics.

<P><B>Existing Collection:</B>         ECS:  4/W

<P>The library's collection in general linguistics has traditionally been strong, especially in the areas listed above and in morphology, comparative grammar, Indo-European philology, and descriptive linguistics.  Dialectology, lexicography. psycholinguistics, and ethnolinguistics have been collected unevenly over time.

<P><B>Current Collecting: </B>       CCI:  4/W

<P>The collection in most areas of theoretical linguistics is being maintained at a 4 level; works that are primarily pedagogical are bought selectively.  There is growing interest in applied linguistics as linked to various linguistic theories, and more is being published and bought in this area.  Less is being acquired at this time in dialectology, artificial languages (such as Esperanto), and lexicography.

<P><B>Subjects Covered: </B>       LC class:  most P's (not media), some PH  and PM

<P>General linguistics, comparative studies and works about languages that do not fall within another Bibliographer's language or subject boundaries:  Basque, American Indian languages, Pacific languages not covered by <A HREF="http://128.253.140.36/cdechols.html">Echols</A>, Finno-Ugric languages not covered by the <A HREF="http://128.253.140.36/cdslavic.html">Slavic Bibliographer</A>, and aboriginal languages of Australia.

<P><B>Exclusions:</B>

<br>Material for the Language Laboratory, and language textbooks.  Linguistics specific to European languages and English is covered by the bibliographers who buy the literatures, and the linguistics of languages covered by the Area Bibliographers is bought by them.  Works on computer linguistics and artificial intelligence are forwarded to the Engineering Library.  Mann buys most of the material on language as related to child development.

<P><I>Notes:
</I>
<br>Occasionally a tape is bought for the Library that complements work being done in the Phonetics Laboratory.
