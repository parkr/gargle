<h2>Geography</h2>

<p><strong>Clientele:</strong> <br>
Although geography as a discipline is not part of Cornell's academic program,
the Library's collections support research in many areas. In addition to
traditional works about the earth as man's home from a physical and historical
aspect, the scope of geography now extends to topics such as: human
organization of space; non-material aspects of space (language, literature,
religion); and patterns of living, including uses and social values of the
landscape. The application of mathematics, simulation, and graphics to spatial
data has spread from political geography to subjects such as architecture,
ecology, and conservation. </p>

<p><strong>Existing collection:</strong> ECS 3 Lang W </p>

<p>The core of the research level collections in Olin are those titles acquired
as monographic series from scholarly societies and institutions;
German-language holdings are particularly strong. These works are not limited
to historical geography but cover the field in all its aspects.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The Library also has traditionally
subscribed to a wide range of standard periodicals and proceedings of scholarly
societies worldwide. </p>

<p><strong>Current Collection:</strong> CCI 3 Lang W </p>

<p>The geography selector covers general geography, historical geography, and
works on exploration.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Titles are added
more selectively on the Arctic and Antarctic, geography as a discipline, and
toponomy. Travel books are purchased selectively. </p>

<p><strong>Subjects covered:</strong> G</p>

<p>Geographical information: emphasis is on North American and Western European
works. </p>

<p><strong>Exclusions:</strong> Textbooks </p>

<p>Notes: The geography fund covers only the core publications and the subjects
mentioned above. Works limited to one region or country are selected by the
area bibliographer. The Maps Curator selects all maps and atlases and advises
on specialized cartographic resources. The Social Sciences Bibliographer
selects works in economic and political geography and reviews titles in human
geography (class GF), which are acquired by Olin and Mann libraries. The
Engineering Library and Mann Library purchase works on geographic information systems.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Books on tourism go to Hotel.<span
