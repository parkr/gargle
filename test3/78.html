<P>Clientele:  
<br>The Martin P. Catherwood Library (ILR) collection
serves the needs of the faculty, both resident (55) and
extension, and students of the New York State School of
Industrial and Labor Relations as its primary mission.  Included
here are graduate students working toward an advanced degree (MS,
MILR, MPS and PhD) from one of the six departments within the
school:  Collective Bargaining, Labor Law and Labor History;
International and Comparative Labor Relations; Labor Economics;
Organizational Behavior; Human Resource Studies and Economic and
Social Statistics.  In addition the Catherwood Library serves as
a resource for a diverse clientele including labor union leaders,
human resource managers, legislators, faculty members from other
universities and practitioners.

<P>1.  Existing Collection:  ESC 5 Language F

<P>Industrial Relations (IR) developed as a distinct academic
subject nearly three quarters of a century ago.  Although
controversy still exists concerning its "intellectual
boundaries," for our purpose it will be defined as "subfields
related to the employment relationship."  This includes human
resource management, collective bargaining, labor law and
organizational behavior.

<P>The existing collection emphasizes all aspects of industrial
relations as briefly described above.  Particular strengths
include collective bargaining, labor law (primarily U.S.), labor
union history and human resource management.  Also very strong,
from an international perspective, are industrial relations
material from Canada, Britain and Australia.  This is especially
true for British labor history.

<P>2.  Current Collecting:  CCI 4+ Language W

<P>Every effort is made to collect, as comprehensively as possible,
in each of those areas where present strengths exist.  Due to the
multi-discplinary focus of industrial relations it is also
necessary to build basic collections (level 2/3) of
monographs and serials from the disciplines of economics, law,
political science, psychology and sociology.  Very recently
greater effort has been placed on obtaining material from the
Pacific Rim, Eastern Europe and Latin America.  Grey literature,
including that from labor unions/employer associations, relevant
women's organizations and various pressure groups, is collected
very extensively.  Doctoral dissertations are added on a
selective basis.




<P>3.  Subjects Covered:
The strength of the ILR collection lies in LC class HD.  It is
here that titles on collective bargaining, industrial relations,
labor disputes, labor economics (employment/unemployment, wage
structure, discrimination, poverty, education and training,
fringe benefits), labor/labor union history, contemporary trade
union issues, as well as those dealing with international and
comparative industrial relations are to be found.  Two other
"micro" areas of strength are HF5549 (human resource studies) and
those components of HM where material on organizational behavior
(organizations, leadership, power, social groups) is found.  In
addition, the collection includes LC classes HA1-200
(selective); HB-HC (very selective); HQ1060-1064, HV, HX (very
selective); KF (primarily labor laws and legislation), KD, KE,
KJ-KZ (very selective - again primarily labor laws and
legislation); T55-60 (selective - primarily work measurements,
industrial efficiency).


<P>Geographical Information:  Catherwood's collections cover he entire world,
but the greatest emphasis at present is on North America and Western Europe. 
This will change as the ILR School embarks on a newly established
"International Initiative."  About two-thirds of faculty members hired since
1988 have international interests and now nearly half of the resident faculty
are teaching or doing research on international topics.

<P>Documents:  The library attempts to collect, except in certain situations
as noted below, a representative selection of international,
national, state and even local documents.  International documents
are particulary strong in ILO material and Catherwood's collections 
 from the OECD and EC are significant, as well.  At the national level an
 emphasis is placed on acquiring statistical data relative, for example, to
employment/unemployment, wages, labor union membership and
strikes/work stoppages.  The same holds true for U.S. State
documents published by Departments of Labor, Employment Security
and Workers' Compensation.  Foreign titles at
the state/provincial level are not collected.

<P>Electronic Resources:
<DL>
<DT>I.  Electronic Selection Criteria:
    <DD>A.  In general, the same selection criteria used for paper
product purchases apply to electronic products.
    <DD>B.  Duplication of a paper product is warranted if its
electronic utility is broader than its paper utility.
Considerations may include, but are not limited to: (1)
preservation (i.e., a CD-ROM of a loose-leaf service may not be
as timely as the paper, but it allows for preserving the loose-
leaf in a time capsule.  Each edition of the CD can be preserved;
whereas the paper is otherwise thrown away); (2) manipulation
(cutting and pasting of software searching enhancements) of the
material has an educational, publication, or research value not
found in the paper product itself.
    <DD>C.  Products which have potential for curriculum use, career
placement training, and research but for which there is not
current demand should be considered if there is a commitment from
the public service staff to train and educate faculty and
students.

    <DD>D.  The added value of being able to search or index
electronically is a major reason to replace paper products with
their electronic equivalents.

<DT>II.  Hardware/Software Considerations:
    <DD>A.  Hardware and/or software which is currently available in
the library dictates the first level of selection possibilities.
Electronic resources which do not require new equipment purchases
are automatically considered.
    <DD>B.  New equipment costs have to be weighed against the
utiltiy and costs of electronic resources being considered; i.e.,
is the resouce valuable enough to be worth not only its price but
the additional hardware and/or software purchase?  And, will the
additional hardware and/or software have potential use for future
electronic source selections?  If the answer is yes to both
questions, this constitutes a second level of selection
possiblity.</DL>

<P>4.  Exclusions:  No format or genre is specifically  excluded; however, the library is very selective in its acquisition of textbooks and of  titles less relevant to research.
