<P>When they write about what they do, especially when brevity is an objective,
specialists use short hand.  This page is intended as a lexicon for those
seeking an understanding of the specialized terms and abbreviations used to
describe library collections and their management.  This document holds a
glossary of expressions used in the policy texts, <A HREF="#def">definitions of
collecting levels</A>, and of the <A HREF="#lan">language codes</A> that
accompany collecting levels.

<H3><P><A NAME="def">Terms and Symbols Used to Describe Collection Levels:</A>
</H3>

<P>Throughout the policies, librarians have expressed evaluations based on a
standard set of numbers and letters.  The headings that order these evaluations
are:
<ul>
<li><strong>ECS</strong>, or <strong>Existing Collection Strength</strong>, a measure of the historical
collection</li>
<li><strong>CCI</strong>, or <strong>Current Collecting Intensity</strong>, which measures the level of
selection at the time the policy was written</li>
<li><strong>DCI</strong>, or <strong>Desired
Collecting Intensity</strong>, suggests a goal that the librarian hopes to achieve in
the future.</li>
</ul></p>

<P>Collection levels as defined by a committee of the American Library Association
are:

<P><strong>5. Comprehensive level.</strong>  A collection in which a library endeavors, so far
as is reasonably possible, to include all significant works of recorded knowledge for
a necessarily defined field.

<P><strong>4. Research level.</strong>  A collection which includes the major published source
materials required for dissertations and independent research, including
materials containing research reporting, new findings, scientific experimental
results, and other information useful to researchers.

<P><strong>3. Study level.</strong>  A collection which supports undergradute or graduate course
work, or sustained independent study; that is, which is adequate to maintain
knowledge of a subject required for limited or generalized purposes, of less
than research intensity.

<P><strong>2. Basic level.</strong>  A highly selective collection which serves to introduce and
define the subject and to indicate the varieties of information available
elsewhere.

<P><strong>1. Minimal level.</strong>  A subject area in which few selections are made beyond very
basic works.

<H3><P><A NAME="lan"></A>Language codes </H3>

<P><strong>E</strong>. English language materials predominate; little or no foreign language
material is in the collection.

<P><strong>F</strong>. Selected foreign language material included, primarily Western European
in addition to English language material.

<P><strong>W</strong>. Wide variety of foreign language material in addition to English language
material.  No programmatic decision is made to restrict materials according to
language.

<P><strong>Y</strong>. Material is primarily in one non-English language. The overall focus is
on collecting material in the vernacular of the area.
