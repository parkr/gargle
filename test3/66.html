<H2><P>Classics</H2>

<P><B>Clientele:</B>    Primary clientele is  the Department of Classics with 10
regular faculty, but there are at least again as many interested faculty in
other departments: History,  Government,  English,  Romance Studies,
Comparative Literature, Philosophy, Near Eastern Studies and History of
Art.


<P><B>Existing collection: </B>          ECS   4--              LANG:      W

<P>Since the Greek and Roman Classics have been taught at Cornell from the
very inception of the University and in fact constituted the core of the
Humanities curriculum well into the 20th century, the existing Classics
collection is quite strong in older text editions, monographs , reference
works and early journal runs. Much of this material is not superseded and
still in active use today. Coverage of the scholarly literature in the
major European languages continues fairly solid up to the  late 1970's.
After that the collection is noticeably uneven, with wide gaps in holdings
of more recent scholarship. Many important series and single monographs are
lacking, primarily although not exclusively of Continental origin, with
holdings of recent Italian publications especially weak ( estimated at no
more than  2+/3- level.)  This greatly detracts from the overall  utility
of the collection since most important scholarship in classics has been and
still is European, with the Italians playing a critical role in Roman
history and archaeology.



<P><B>Current collecting:</B>       CCI  3+                        LANG:      W

<P>Available resources are insufficient to acquire more than a selection of
currently published literature, let alone any retrospective material. As a
results, existing gaps are perpetuated and new ones continuously formed.
Priority is given to maintaining the existing base of serials and
monographic series. Remaining funds are used to acquire, on a highly
selective basis, monographs relevant to known research interests of the
current faculty. No   electronic resources (a few very useful but expensive
CD-ROM versions  of large texts are available) can be acquired.  No new
series subscriptions can be started which is unfortunate  since much of the
important literature in Classics is published in series.



<P><B>Subjects covered: </B>         LC classes;   B 108-708,  BL 780829,  CN 350-740,
DF 10-289,DG 11-365,  KJA,  PA 1-4500, PA 6001-6971.
                                                               
<P>The collection  covers all aspects of the civilizations of ancient Greece
and Rome:  archaeology,  history, government, economics, society, language
& literature, religion & mythology,  philosophy, epigraphy, numismatics and
law.  General chronological boundaries are  from the Bronze age (ca. 2500
B.C on Crete)  to the fall of the Roman Empire in the west (476 A.D.)
Geographically selection extends to all areas which fell within the
Greaco-Roman cultural or political sphere, but only  for those periods
during which such inclusion was actually in force.  For example, Roman
Britain is included, but pre-Roman  (i.e. Celtic) and post-Roman (i.e
Anglo-Saxon) Britain is not. Languages include all known Greek  dialects,
all Italic dialects and all non-Italic dialects of the Italian peninsula.
Also included is the study of the Classics and the history of Classical
scholarship in all periods and places.

<P><B>Geographical information:
</B>
<P>In order of importance,  Germany, France, Britain, Italy, the United States
and the Netherlands are the leading centers of contemporary scholarly
publication in Classics. The second tier includes the remaining Western
European countries. There is some activity in a few countries outside of
Europe, notably  the larger Latin American countries, Japan, Australia and
Israel, but  while some of these contributions may be individually
important in the aggregate they amount to only a small fraction of the
overall output in the field. One reason for this is that  much of the
significant non-European  (except U.S)  scholarship is actually published
by European publishers.



<P><B>Exclusions:</B>

<P>1.   Greek and Roman music:  collected by Music Library.

<br>2.  Greek and Roman art :  collected  primarily by FAL. Some material may
be collected for Olin, especially if it is part of general Classics series.

<br>3. Greek and Roman Science:   collected by History of Science
bibliographers.

<br>4. Any aspects of Judaism in the Graeco-Roman world, including Jewish
writings in  Greek  (e. Josephus, Septuagint): collected by Jewish Studies
bibliographer.

<br>5. Most early Christian (Patristic) writings  even if composed before  476
