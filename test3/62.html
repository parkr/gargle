  <p><strong>Clientele: </strong><br>
The general bibliography collections support research in most subject areas,
although primary users are humanists. </p>

  <p><strong>Existing collection: </strong><br>
ECS Language: W <br>
4 (bibliography) <br>
3 (information science) </p>

<p>Cornell's collections are strongest in the history of books, the history of
printing, and the history of bookselling and publishing.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Emphasis is on European history until 1900,
especially the book trade of the Middle Ages, and on 20th century U. S.,
British, and German publishing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>All
available national bibliographies and catalogs of major manuscript collections
are acquired. </p>

<p>For the history of libraries, specialized periodicals and monographs have
been collected.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A special effort was
made to receive all current publications of scholarly institutions.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Works about academic research libraries were
collected at a research level; other monographs were collected at a 3 level. </p>

  <p><strong>Current collection: </strong><br>
CCI Language: W <br>
4 (bibliography) <br>
3 (information science) </p>

<p>Traditional strengths are supported currently.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Works on the history of bibliography, and anonyma and pseudonyma,
are collected intensively. Current and retrospective national bibliographies
are acquired, including those in new formats when funds permit.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Works on cataloging, collection development,
and reference are added regularly only if applicable to college and university
libraries.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Wide-ranging statistical
compilations and any statistics pertaining to research libraries are collected
in depth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Also covered by this fund are
works about collecting books, and some general book review titles.</p>

  <p><strong>Geographical information</strong>: Coverage on national and trade 
    bibliography is worldwide; the majority of monographs are U. S. or European 
    in origin. </p>

  <p><strong>Exclusions:</strong> Textbooks; technical works on information science: 
    most titles of primary interest to school and public libraries. </p>

  <p><strong>Notes:</strong> Most libraries at Cornell acquire occasional information 
    science titles as needed to support their service programs.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Technical aspects of information science are collected in the Engineering 
    Library.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The Cornell Library classifies 
    subject bibliographies, as well as general and national bibliography, in the 
    Z classification. All selectors are responsible for acquiring Z titles in 
    their specific subject fields or geographical area. </p>

<p>The Law Library is responsible for covering the legal aspects of copyright
and censorship. Olin Library collects works on freedom of the press and on the
history of censorship and copyright. </p>
