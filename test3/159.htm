          <h4>Cornell Faculty Senate Resolution</h4>
          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Resolution 
            regarding the University Library&#8217;s Policies on Serials Acquisitions, 
            with Special Reference to Negotiations with Elsevier<br />
            </strong></font><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br />
            Submitted by the Faculty Library Advisory Board for consideration 
            at the December 17, 2003 meeting of the University Faculty Senate<br />
            <br />
            <strong>BACKGROUND</strong><br />
            <br />
            <strong>A Crisis in the Cost of Journals in the Sciences and Social 
            Sciences<br />
            </strong><br />
            For many years, increases in the prices of library materials have 
            exceeded increases in library acquisitions budgets, at Cornell and 
            abroad. One significant reason is the growing commercialization of 
            scholarly publishing, especially in the sciences and social sciences 
            and especially where journals are concerned. Statistics from the Association 
            of Research Libraries (<a href="http://www.arl.org/stats/arlstat/graphs/2001/2001t2.html">http://www.arl.org/stats/arlstat/graphs/2001/2001t2.html</a>) 
            show that over the fifteen years from 1986 to 2001 the prices of serials 
            generally increased by 215%, library expenditures on serials went 
            up by 210%, and the number of serials titles purchased by large academic 
            research libraries decreased by 5%. The Consumer Price Index during 
            the same period increased by only 62%.<br />
            <br />
            At Cornell, Ithaca campus library budgets for materials increased 
            by 149% during approximately the same period, but the number of serials 
            titles purchased increased by only 5%&#8212;at a time when the number 
            of serials published increased by approximately 138%. The contract 
            colleges subscribe to 14% fewer serials than they did fifteen years 
            ago, even though their combined library acquisitions budgets have 
            increased by 117% during that period.<br />
            <br />
            Commercial publishers charge more&#8212;sometimes many times more&#8212;for 
            their materials than scholarly societies or university presses do. 
            The Dutch company Elsevier, which publishes mainly science journals, 
            is the best example. Over the last decade Elsevier&#8217;s price increases 
            have often been over 10% and occasionally over 20% on a year to year 
            basis. (They have recently announced a policy of not raising prices 
            by more than 10% in a given year.) In 2003 Cornell subscribed to 930 Elsevier titles at 
            a cost of approximately $1.7 million. Those 930 titles represent fewer 
            than 2% of the total number of serials titles to which Cornell subscribes; 
            the $1.7 million comprises something over 20% of the library&#8217;s 
            total serials expenditures, including those of the Medical School. 
            Elsevier&#8217;s proposed price increase of 6.5% for 2004 would have 
            required an increase in the library&#8217;s serials expenditures of approximately $100,000. By 
            contrast, the library&#8217;s total materials budget, including materials 
            for the Medical School, has in fact decreased by 1.4%. It is clear 
            that increases of the magnitude that Elsevier regularly expects have 
            become quite literally unbearable. The long-term trends of which these 
            particular increases are a part are therefore also unsustainable.<br />
            </font><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br />
            The Cornell library&#8217;s relationship with Elsevier has given definition 
            and urgency to problems the library has been facing for some time 
            and that extend beyond Elsevier to include other commercial publishers.<br />
            <br />
            <strong>Elsevier&#8217;s pricing practices</strong><br />
            <br />
            One way the library can accommodate increases in serials prices that 
            exceed increases in the library&#8217;s budget is by canceling some 
            titles. Elsevier&#8217;s pricing practices, however, make this straightforward 
            solution especially costly. In the past, Cornell has contracted with 
            Elsevier for a package of journals and electronic services. The contract 
            has been priced as a &#8220;bundle,&#8221; that is, in such a way that, if 
            the library cancels any of the Elsevier journals it currently subscribes 
            to, the pricing of the other individual journals the library chooses 
            to keep increases substantially. (The actual process is somewhat more 
            complicated than this, but this is the end result.) Because the prices 
            of the journals that are retained greatly increase when others are 
            cancelled, the only way to achieve any real savings is to cancel a great many journals.<br />
            <br />
            In 2003 the library was able to maintain its subscriptions to Elsevier 
            journals only because of one-time assistance from an extra-budgetary 
            source. Given that the library cannot bear Elsevier&#8217;s price 
            increases for 2004, it has decided that it must withdraw from the 
            bundled pricing plan that has characterized past contracts and begin 
            canceling Elsevier journal titles. The library, in consultation with 
            affected faculty, has identified several hundred Elsevier journals for cancellation at the end of 2003.<br />
            <br />
            There are two clear benefits to this course of action: it enables 
            the library to retain the most important Elsevier titles without drastically 
            impacting serials collections and the library&#8217;s ability to acquire 
            non-Elsevier journals and non-serials materials, and it frees the 
            library, in 2004 and in the future, from contractual obligations that 
            have in effect compromised its ability to make case-by-case judgments 
            about the value to thecollection of particular Elsevier journals.<br />
            <br />
            Understandably, there is growing dissatisfaction at universities in 
            the United States with Elsevier&#8217;s prices and pricing practices 
            and increasing militancy among university librarians and faculty with 
            regard to modes of response. Cornell&#8217;s announced intention to 
            withdraw from the standard contractual arrangements with Elsevier 
            for 2004 has received substantial attention in the press. Cornell 
            is clearly perceived as assuming a leadership role in these matters. Moreover, the faculty at some other 
            major universities have endorsed or are considering endorsing resolutions 
            designed to address, in varying ways, this same set of issues.<br />

            library has set up to explain these issues: <a href="problem.html">http://www.library.cornell.edu/scholarlycomm/problem.html</a>)<br />
            </font></font><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br />
            <strong>BE IT RESOLVED THAT:</strong><br />
            <br />
            <strong>(1)</strong> The University Faculty Senate supports the library&#8217;s 
            efforts to maintain and enhance the outstanding quality of Cornell&#8217;s 
            library collections for teaching and research. Moreover, recognizing 
            the special challenges presented by current economic, market, and 
            budgetary conditions, the University Faculty Senate supports the library&#8217;s 
            efforts to bring serials costs under control while at the same time 
            maintaining the collection&#8217;s uality.<br />
            <br />
            <strong>(2)</strong> Recognizing that given present and future budget 
            constraints, the library requires autonomy and flexibility to manage 
            its materials acquisitions decisions effectively, the University Faculty 
            Senate endorses the library&#8217;s decision to withdraw from Elsevier&#8217;s 
            bundled pricing plan and undertake selective cancellation of Elsevier 
            journals as deemed appropriate by the library in consultation with 
            the faculty.<br />
            <br />
            <strong>(3)</strong> Recognizing that current trends regarding serials 
            costs are unsustainable and that the current business models and marketing 
            strategies of commercial publishers bear significant responsibility 
            for those trends, the University Faculty Senate encourages the library 
            to take an aggressive approach in negotiating new contractual models 
            and pricing structures with Elsevier and other commercial publishers designed 
            to bring serials costs in line with realistic long-term library budget 
            projections.<br />
            <br />
            <strong>(4)</strong> Recognizing that the cost of Elsevier journals 
            in particular is radically out of proportion with the importance of 
            those journals to the library&#8217;s serials collection (measured 
            both in terms of the proportion of the total collection they represent 
            and in terms of their use by and value to faculty and students), the 
            University Faculty Senate encourages the library to seek in the near 
            term, in consultation with the faculty, to reduce its expenditures 
            on Elsevier journals to no more than 15% of its total annual serials acquisitions expenditures (from in excess of 20% in 2003). 
            Moreover, the University Faculty Senate encourages the library to 
            work toward long-term pricing structures with Elsevier and other publishers 
            based on reasonable measures of a subscription&#8217;s importance 
            to the Cornell collection.<br />
            <br />
            <strong>(5)</strong> Recognizing that the increasing control by large 
            commercial publishers over the publication and distribution of the 
            faculty&#8217;s scholarship and research threatens to undermine core 
            academic values promoting broad and rapid dissemination of new knowledge 
            and unrestricted access to the results of scholarship and research, 
            the University Faculty Senate encourages the library and the faculty 
            vigorously to explore and support alternatives to commercial venues for scholarly communication.</font></p>
