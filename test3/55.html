<H2>Collection Development Policy for Sub-Saharan Africa</H2>




<P>Purpose:

<br>	Materials on the history and culture of Sub-Saharan Africa are acquired for the John M. Olin Library to support the instructional and research programs of the University.  These programs vary from beginning undergraduate courses to post-doctoral research.  The programs served by the collection include, but are not limited to, the Africana Studies & Research Center, departments of Anthropology, City & Regional Planning, Economics, English, Government, History, Linguistics, Sociology, and the Institute for African Development.

<P>	The Library maintains blanket orders for all North American university press books and subscriptions to most major series and research journals from North America and Europe.  It also maintains approval plans with several African imprint dealers, participates in the Library of Congress East Africa Cooperative Acquisitions Program, and buys selectively from the output of publishers not included in any of the above. The Library's collection on African Studies is currently estimated at over 50,000 titles housed in Olin Library. Collecting emphasis is on social science and humanities titles. Olin's African Studies selector does not acquire materials in 1) science and technology, 2) agriculture, 3) music 4) art, 5) labor studies, or 6) law.  These subjects are within the jurisdiction of the Engineering, Physical Sciences, Mann, <A HREF="cdmusic.html">Music</A>,<A HREF="cdfinearts.html"> Fine Arts</A>, ILR, and Law libraries, respectively and are purchased and housed there.

<P>1. Geographic and Language Parameters:

<br>	English, French, and German, in that order, are the primary languages  of the collection.   Dictionaries and grammars (PL 8000-8844) and some literature (PR 9340-9408, PQ 3980-3989) are collected in indigenous African languages, especially in Kiswahali, Yoruba, Ewe, Malinke, and Zulu.  Priority is given to material within the selector's subject areas (described below) which compare multiple African countries or cover the continent generally, and to material which focuses specifically on any of the following countries.  Materials focusing on other countries are considered upon upon user request.
