  <div class="content"> 
            <p align="left"><strong>Overview<br />
            </strong><font size="2">In order
                to make scholarly information more accessible  and affordable,
                a number of alternatives, made possible with the technology 
                of the internet, have been proposed. Some of them fall within
                the  definition of what is called Open Access. In 2002, the <a 
href="http://www.soros.org/openaccess/read.shtml" target="_blank">Budapest Open Access Initiative</a> 
              defined open access as the "world-wide electronic distribution
              of  the peer-reviewed journal literature, completely free and unrestricted
               access to it by all scientists, scholars, teachers, students,
              and  other curious minds." Obviously such publishing, like all
              publishing,  has a cost. As such, someone other than the reader
              (or the reader's  library) would pay for the publication-and much
              of the discussion  so far has been how that cost might be paid
              for. </font></p>
        </div>
  <div class="content">
    <p><font size="2">Currently there are two complementary strategies for 
              achieving open access to scholarly journal literature. The first 
              is depositing of preprints in an open access digital achive (such as <a href="http://ecommons.library.cornell.edu/index.jsp" target="_blank">Cornell University's eCommons</a>) hosted by an institution 
              or discipline. The second is publishing in peer reviewed <a 
href="http://www.doaj.org/" target="_blank">open access journals</a>. In some cases there will 
              be overlap between the two in that some self-archived materials will 
              also have been peer reviewed and accepted for publication.</font></p>
  </div>
  <div class="content">
            <p><font size="2">            Another definition of Open Access publishing comes from a meeting 
              of the biomedical community held on April 11, 2003 in Bethesda, Maryland, 
              and is commonly referred to as the <a 
href="http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/bethesda.htm" target="_blank">Bethesda Statement on Open 
              Access Publishing</a>. It is composed of two clauses, one concerning 
              copyright and the other concerning archival copies and access: An 
            Open Access Publication is one that meets the following two conditions:</font></p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p><font size="2">              1) The author(s) and copyright holder(s) grant(s) to all users a 
                free, irrevocable, worldwide, perpetual right of access to, and 
                a license to copy, use, distribute, transmit and display the work 
                publicly and to make and distribute derivative works, in any digital 
                medium for any responsible purpose, subject to proper attribution 
                of authorship, as well as the right to make small numbers of printed 
              copies for their personal use.</font></p>
              <p><font size="2">              2) A complete version of the work and all supplemental materials, 
                including a copy of the permission as stated above, in a suitable 
                standard electronic format is deposited immediately upon initial 
                publication in at least one online repository that is supported 
                by an academic institution, scholarly society, government agency, 
                or other well-established organization that seeks to enable open 
                access, unrestricted distribution, interoperability, and long-term 
              archiving (for the biomedical sciences, <a 
  href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/" target="_blank">PubMed Central</a> is such a repository).</font></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><font size="2">The third major defintion is the Berlin Declaration
