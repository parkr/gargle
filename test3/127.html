The Library Annex is primarily a storage facility for lesser-used materials from the collections of CUL. While the majority of materials at the Annex are books, it also contains more than 27,500 cubic feet of manuscript material from the Division of Rare and Manuscript Collections and the Kheel Center for Labor-Management Documentation and Archives. Over the next two years, one million volumes will be moved into the new Annex addition (see <A HREF = "http://www.library.cornell.edu/newannex/" target="_top">Library Annex Expansion Project</a>).

<P>

Material from the Annex can be delivered to the Cornell library of your choice and will normally be available at the circulation desk there within 24 hours, Monday - Friday. Items may also be held at the Annex reading room, to be checked out or used there. Because the Annex uses high-density storage techniques, it is not a browsing library and the retrieval of requested material takes some time. Therefore, we ask that you provide us at least two hours advance notice when requesting items to be held for you. Either of these types of <EM>original material</EM> requests may be made with the <A HREF = "http://campusgw.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/manntom.cgi?section=services&URL=cgi-bin/annex/annexreq.cgi">Annex request form</A>.

<P>
As an alternative, you may find it convenient to use our <EM>document delivery </EM>service. If you have a valid Cornell ID and are requesting journal articles or tables of contents, you may request that copies of these materials be delivered to you directly, either via the Web (<A HREF="http://www.library.cornell.edu/okuaccess/annex/edd/">EDD</A>) or by fax.  For this service, please use the <A HREF = "http://campusgw.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/manntom.cgi?section=services&URL=cgi-bin/annex/ddanxreq.cgi">document delivery request form</A>
