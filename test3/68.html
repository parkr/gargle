<H2><P>			Echols Collection Policy</H2>

<P>The John M. Echols Southeast Asia collection's roots are in Charles Wason's library of western language books on the Chinese which he donated to Cornell in 1919.  About that same time the foundation was laid for the Library's huge archive of private papers and documents about Southeast Asia by Jacob Gould Schurman, Cornell's president from 1892-1920, who chaired the Philippine Commission. Schurman's strong feelings about the need to prepare the Philippines for independence established a special relationship for subsequent generations of Cornell educators and researchers who worked in the region, and youths from Southeast Asia who attended Cornell and later rose to prominence in their respective countries.  

<P>The concept of Southeast Asia as a region arose during World War II and extended from eastern India and southwestern China to the northern shore of Australia,  then along the eastern face of the Philippines. Included in the region are the nations of Brunei, Burma(Mayanmar), Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. While this strategic definition is still used by the region's leaders in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), ancient cultural influences tend to fuse the peoples of the region with both Indic and Sinic traditions. For this reason the  inter-shelving of East and South Asian collections with our own in the new Kroch Library is particularly appropriate. 

<P>The Southeast Asia Program gained a momentum of its own through a Rockefeller grant in 1951.  While secured by faculty in East Asian Studies,  Cornell President John Malott's personal commitment to match the grant with internal funds enabled Cornell to establish a distinguisted Southeast Asia Program (SEAP) with powerful library resources.  At that time Cornell joined the Farmington Plan, a book acquisitions scheme designed by the federal government to use surplus currencies for vernacular language publications. After the Farmington Plan phased out, the 1958 National Defense Education Act established National Resource Centers (NRC) for each region of the non-western world, with funds committed to buy publications in every subject. Cornell received the first Southeast Asian center grant, which has been renewed annually and is the oldest continuously supported NRC in the United States. The Rockefeller, Ford, and Mellon Foundations awarded endowments which continue to provide funding for library staff and acquisitions, a tradition that distinguishes the Echols Collection from all others at Cornell and other Southeast Asia Collections in the United States.

<P><B>Clientele:
</B><br>The primary clientele for the John M. Echols Collection is the global
community of scholars interested in Southeast Asia.  The Echols Collection is the library of record for Southeast Asia in many subject fields and its largest users are through interlibrary services. Cornell has a strong Southeast Asia Program and the 15 faculty, 95 graduate students, 5-10 visiting scholars, and dozen undergraduate majors constitute our resident users.

<P><B>Collection Description:
</B><br>In 1993 the Collection consisted of 230,000 volumes, plus an equal number of microtext items, and some 50,000 serial titles.  An estimated 30,000 photographic items, some 2,000 audio and 300 video cassettes, a rapidly expanding set of electronic data bases, and over 200 cubic feet of papers and documents dealing with Southeast Asia, are held in our archives and other Cornell libraries. Bibliographic records for most of these records are now accessible on-line.

<P>Existing strength is at the 5 level in all languages in some 78 subjects (see attached Subject conspectus).  Budget constraints in the past three years have caused us to lower our current goal to 3 W in seventeen subjects, while retaining 5 F in 61 subjects defined for participants in the Library of Congress Overseas Acquisitions Program.
