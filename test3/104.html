<P>
<U>Gift Giving</U>
<P>
The Cornell University Library welcomes and encourages gifts in
support of the University's programs. Indeed, the Library relies
heavily upon donors to help sustain its growth, many of the Library's
most valuable resources and special collections originated in
this way. Gifts of money, books, periodicals, equipment, and other
research materials contribute to the Library's development. Modest
gifts are much appreciated, as are bequests, endowments, and larger
contributions.
<P>
In preparation for receiving gifts of books or other materials
(referred to as gift-in-kind), the Library encourages donors to
provide a list of materials including the name, dates, and general
condition of the material. Because of the complex nature of Cornell's
library system, it is often necessary to impose certain conditions
upon acceptance of gifts. If gifts are accepted it should be understood
that, upon receipt the University becomes the owner of the material
and, as such, reserves the right to determine its retention, location,
cataloging treatment, and other considerations related to its
use, maintenance, or removal. We ask donors to also consider giving
a minimum of $1,000 per 100 volumes donated to help expedite processing
as well as defray costs of maintaining the material given to the
Library.
<P>
<U>Appraisal</U>
<P>
The Library encourages donors to consider, for their own interest,
obtaining an appraisal of their gifts for income tax purposes.
Such appraisals are the responsibility of the donor and should
be made, if possible, before the gifts are transferred to Cornell
in order to establish their fair market value. The Internal Revenue
Service considers the Library to be an interested party which
therefore precludes appraisals made or financed by Cornell. For
this reason, donors must bear the costs of appraisal, but the
costs may be deductible expenses. As income and estate tax laws
are subject to frequent revision, Cornell recommends that donors
discuss gifts-in-kind appraisals with their attorneys. The Library
is willing to help by suggesting appropriate professional appraisers
who might be consulted, or by arranging for third-party appraisals
after receipt of the gift in the library. The acceptance of a
gift which has been appraised by a disinterested party does not
in any way imply endorsement of the appraisal by the Library.
<P>
<U>Acknowledgment</U>
<P>
The Library acknowledges all gifts it receives. The Cornell University
Office of External Relations will send the donor a receipt and
a signed copy of IRS form #8283. We also provide gift and/or class
credit for gifts-in-kind which include an appraisal or valuation
by the donor.
