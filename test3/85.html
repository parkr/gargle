<H2><P>Management Library</H2>

<P><B>Clientele:
</B><br>The Management Library collection primarily serves the research and curriculum needs of the 
faculty and students of the Johnson Graduate School of Management.  The Library's collection is 
available to all members of the Cornell community and serves the needs of faculty students and 
staff with research interests in management and the business disciplines.  The major areas of 
concentration in the Johnson School are: Accounting, Behavioral and Organizational Science, 
Economics, Finance, Marketing, Operations Management and Management Information Systems.

<P><B>Collection:
</B><br>The Management Library collection has been developed to support a professional school of 
management education with a research-oriented faculty.  Students examine business organizations 
and administrative responsibilities and relationships with the aid of perspectives from the social 
and behavioral sciences.   In addition to the areas of concentration listed above, the collection 
covers decision making, economic analysis, entrepreneurship and international business.  The 
Library includes an extensive collection of corporate reports, domestic and international including 
annual reports, 10-Ks and corporate proxies.


<P><B>Subjects Covered:
</B><DL>
<DT>The major areas of concentration in the Johnson School are: 
<DT>Accounting (HF), 
<DT>Behavioral and Organizational Science (HD,HM,BF), 
<DT>Economics (HA,HB,HC), 
<DT>Finance (HG), 
<DT>Marketing (HF), 
<DT>Operations Management (HD,Q,QA,T) and 
<DT>Management Information Systems (HF,Q,QA,T).</DL>  

<P>A summary of subjects collected is included below.

<P>Electronic Resources:
<br>Electronic resources have become a major focus of the Management Library collections.  The 
importance of current information and the availability of business information in electronic format 
has supported this initiative.  The Library supports 1) access to remote commercial business 
information services, 2) CD ROM subscriptions to bibliographic numerical and textual resources, 
and 3) network mounted bibliographic files.  The Library's electronic resources benefit from gifts-
in-kind (Bloomberg, Bridge Information  and First Call)

<P>Documents:
<br>The Library has strong holdings document serials and periodicals relating to trade, economic and 
business conditions including industry regulation.   The focus is on United States and regional 
international organizations (UN., OECD) publications rather that individual countries.  
Duplication with other Cornell collections is monitored carefully.  Document monographs, 
hearings and reports are collectively very selectively.  Management relies on other Cornell 
collections for access to these documents.

<P><B>Geographical Information:
</B><br>English language materials are purchased from around the world.  As business has become more 
global, so has the Management Library collection.  In all areas of concentration, materials with an 
international perspective have been collected.  The collection reflects the increasing interest in 
international business.  Information on international corporations is actively collected.  In the past 
the collections focused on the industrialized nations.  In recent years this have been expanded to 
include emerging economies.  Two of the Library's endowments support collecting of 
international materials.  In general the collection focuses on the international aspects of business 
and management particularly multinational corporations.  Foreign language materials are collected by area bibliographers and curators in Olin and Kroch Libraries.

<P><B>Exclusions:
</B><br>Textbooks: only required texts are purchased and gifts added selectively.
<br>Reprints excluded
<br>Foreign language materials
<br>Cases: the Library purchases case bibliographies.

<P><B>Duplication:
</B><br>The Cornell University Library carries multiple subscriptions to major United States government, United 
Nations and OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development) statistical 
publications.  Major trade magazines and research journals are also duplicated on campus (e.g. 
Business Week, Harvard Business Review.)  The Management duplicates monographs based on 
anticipated need for multiple copies.

<P><I>Notes:
</I><br>Preservation microfilm is purchased when funds are available.
<br>Duplication is avoided unless materials are central to the needs of the School.  (Duplicate gift 
titles are added liberally.)
<br>Career and placement materials are purchased with funds from the School.
