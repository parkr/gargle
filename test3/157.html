  <p>Scholarly
    communication—the process used by scholars to share the results of their
    research—is fast approaching a crossroads. Individual disciplines and the
    scholarly community as a whole will soon need to make far-ranging decisions
    about how scholarly information is formally and informally exchanged, because
    current methods of scholarly communication are increasingly restrictive and
    are economically unsustainable. The purposes of this Web page are (a) to
    inform Cornell faculty of some of the key issues that drive the debates over
    scholarly communication, and (b) to suggest action that faculty might consider
    to support needed changes. </p>
  <p>1. <a href="http://www.library.cornell.edu/scholarlycomm/copyright/">Copyright
    of Faculty Publications</a>. There is no one reason for—no single approach
    to—the crisis in scholarly communication. It is perhaps most easily described
    in terms of access, ownership and compensation. Suppose a scholar writes a
    paper and submits it to a well known journal. The editors accept the paper and
    agree to publish it. In many instances it is still the case that the publisher
    requires that the writer give the ownership (copyright) of the paper to the
    publisher, in return for publication. Anyone whose library does not subscribe
    to the journal, or who does not have a personal subscription, can then often
    only gain access to the article by paying a (frequently significant) copyright
    fee. Access to such specialized information is in any case highly restricted
    to ensure that publishers are effectively compensated. One approach to making
    scholarly information more broadly accessible is for scholars to retain more
    control over the ownership of their own publications. This Web site will
    suggest how this can be done by making adjustments to copyright agreements
    when submitting materials for publication. </p>
  <p>2. <a href="http://www.library.cornell.edu/scholarlycomm/serials/">The
    Crisis in Scholarly Publication Prices</a>. The prices of scholarly
    publications, and especially those of serials, have increased at a rate far
    above inflation and much more rapidly than increases in library budgets. This
    is especially the case with many commercial publishers—and also a few society
    publishers. The result is that libraries are now only able to provide their
    users with access to an increasingly smaller portion of the total needed
    scholarly output. This is affecting access and services not just in the
    sciences and technology but in all subject areas. We are providing Cornell
    faculty on this Web site a fuller explanation of the reasons for these pricing
    problems, as well as some suggestions about actions scholars might take to
    reduce such pressures. </p>
  <p>3. <a href="http://www.library.cornell.edu/scholarlycomm/affordable/">Alternative
    Publishing Models</a>. Scholars and libraries, preferably working closely with
    publishers, need to take action to ensure that scholarly publication remains
    scalable and sustainable, and so that all who need access to specialized
    scholarly information have it. Leading academic libraries in the U.S. and
    abroad have been developing a range of alternatives to the current scholarly
    communication paradigm. We will describe and link to some of these options on
    this Web site. We will discuss especially what we are doing here at Cornell,
    where the Library co-manages, with Duke University Press, Project Euclid, an
    online publishing service for mathematics journals. The Library is also
    responsible for the heavily used physics pre-print server, arXiv. Cornell has,
    in addition, an institutional repository, where faculty can deposit online
    copies of their publications and data. The Library also has the ability to
    assist faculty in starting their own online publications. Perhaps most
    importantly, the Cornell Library—and the academic library community—are
    committed to the long-term preservation of any and all electronic materials
    entrusted to their care.</p>
  <p>4. <a href="openaccess/index.html">Open Access</a>. One particularly
    intriguing and promising alternative to traditional scholarly communication is
    open access. The basic concept is that neither the reader nor the reader’s
    library would pay for access to scholarly publications: these would rather be
    freely accessible to the world on the Internet. Such an approach would be
    inadvisable and indeed impossible for popular publications, but it certainly
    does make some sense for (at least some kinds of) specialized scholarly
    publications. The obvious question is, if the reader (or the reader’s
    library-agent) does not pay for access, who does pay—i.e., who pays for the
    costs of production and distribution? There has been a great deal of
    discussion of, advocacy for, and objection to open access over the past two
    years. This Web site will provide Cornell faculty with a summary of the
    current debate, as well as links to further information.</p>
