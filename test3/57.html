<H2><P>Ancient History</H2>



<P><B>Clientele: </B>   Primary clientele  are faculty in the Department of Near
Eastern Studies, but there are additional users in the departments of
History,  Classics, Comparative Literature,  History of Art and English.


<P><B>Existing collection:</B>                 ECS    3+               LANG:   W

<P>Holdings of the core scholarly literature of the field are reasonably solid
from the mid-19th century to the late 1970's, including standard reference
works and full runs of all major journals and of many major archaeological
reports series. Much of this material has not been superseded and is still
being used actively today.  Coverage declines abruptly after ca. 1980, with
major gaps in  monographs, journals and report series. Many important
monographic series started after 1980  are absent, as are reports of major
excavations and catalogs of major museum collections.   This is the case
with publications  from all major European countries.  Publications from
present day Middle Eastern countries, especially in the respective
vernacular languages, are hardly represented at all.


<P><B>Current collecting:</B>              CCI  3                       LANG:   F

<P>Available resources are insufficient to acquire more than a very limited
selection of currently published literature, let alone any retrospective
material. As a result, existing gaps are perpetuated and new ones
continually formed. Priority is given to maintaining the existing base of
serials and monographic series. Remaining funds, if any, are used to
purchase monographs relevant to known research interests of the current
faculty, meaning more attention  is being paid to ancient Mesopotamia,
Syria and Anatolia and less to ancient Egypt, Iran and Arabia.  No new
series have been started for a number of years, which greatly reduces the
overall utility of collection since most important new research in this
field is published as part of series, either monographic series or
archaeological excavation reports. Acquisitions are limited to materials in
Western European languages. Although some important material is published
in Arabic, Turkish and Persian, especially  reports of excavations by
Middle Eastern archaeologists,  it is considered of lower priority and
almost never bought because  it is sometimes difficult to obtain and
relatively few Cornell users can read these languages.



<P><B>Subjects covered:   </B>          LC classes; BL 1500-1700,  DS 41-66,  DT 57-93,
 PJ 1001-2199,  PJ 3101-40.

<P>The collection covers all aspects of the civilizations of the non-Israelite
Ancient Near East, from prehistoric times to , depending on the area, the
Greek, Roman or Islamic conquest.   Covered are archaeology, epigraphy,
language & literature, religion & mythology, government, society and
economy. Geographically  coverage extends to: (1)
Egypt, including adjacent African areas showing strong Egyptian influence
(e.g Nubia, Sudan)   (2)  Levant, including all  non-Israelite cultures
that existed in what is now  Syria, Lebanon, Israel/Palestine and Jordan.
(e.g Ugarit, Ebla, Phoenicia)  (3) Mesopotamia (Sumer, Akkad, Assyria,
Babylonia etc.)    (4) Ancient Iran, including Iranian culture in any parts
of present day Afghanistan and  the Caucasus.  (5) Arabian Peninsula. (6)
Anatolia, including all non-Greek cultures (e.g Lydian, Hittite).
<p>
<B>Geographical information:</B>

<P>Virtually  all of the information about ancient Near Eastern cultures is
derived from records - written or artifactual  - which have come to light
as a result of archaeological  excavations. Since most archaeological work,
as well as the interpretation of the finds, has been done by West European
and North American scholars,  publication has also been centered there. In
order of importance, Germany, France, Britain, Belgium,  Italy, the
Netherlands and the United States have been the leading centers of
scholarly publication. The second tier consists of the remaining West
European countries, along with several Middle Eastern countries:  Egypt,
Syria, Iraq, Iran and Saudi Arabia. Beyond that, there is modest  activity
in a few other countries, notably Japan and Australia.



<P><B>Exclusions:
</B>
<P>1.  Writings on the culture and civilization of  ancient Israel and the
Jews, including Bible and Holy Land archaeology:  collected by Jewish
Studies bibliographer.

<br>2. Ancient Near Eastern music; collected by the Music Library.

<br>3. Ancient Near Eastern art :  collected primarily by FAL, but some may be
in Olin, especially if it is part of archaeological series.

<br>4. sub-Saharan Africa, North African cultures unrelated to ancient Egypt,
African prehistory.

<br>5. Armenia, Afghanistan, Caucasus and Central Asia  unless part of
pre-Islamic Iranian culture.
