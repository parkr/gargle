<H2><P>American History</H2>



<P><B>Clientele: </B> The American History collection serves the needs of faculty and students in the History Department as well as a number of other departments across campus.  There are at least twenty faculty members directly involved in American History and an undeterminant number, in such diverse areas as American Literature or Science and Technology Studies, who are interested in various aspects of the history of the United States.  The collection supports a broad range of undergraduate and graduate courses.  Scholars from all over the country and the world also utilize the American History collection.



<P><B>Existing Collection:</B>  ECS 4      LANGUAGE  W

<P>	Cornell's American History collection has been historically strong across the board.  Collecting has been as comprehensive as possible with strength and depth in all chronological periods of US history (colonial and national eras).  All major journals are included, as well as many local history journals.  An important feature of Cornell's collection is our strength in local history.



<P><B>Current Collecting:</B>    CCI  4      LANGUAGE  W

<P>	We continue to collect as comprehensively as possible in all areas of US history.  Faculty and graduate student interests are important influences on collecting, but we also support areas--such as the American Civil War or western land expansion--in which we have strong collections, but little current on-campus interest.  Budgetary constraints in recent years have limited the number of large micro-form sets purchased.  Such collections are now purchased only in response to specific faculty requests.



<P><B>Subjects Covered: </B> LC classes E and F 1 to F975

<P>	All subjects under these classes are collected.



<P><B>Geographical Information: </B> There is no geographical limitation.  Imprints from all countries, in all languages, are in scope.



<P><B>Exclusions:</B>
	
<P>	1.  Juvenile literature
<br>2.  Genealogy (except for some broad reference works and works on NYS families) 	
<br>3.  Manuscripts and archives materials
<br>4.  Rare books
<br>5.  Newspapers
<br>6.  Textbooks


<P><I>Notes:</I>  Some aspects of American history are covered in the "H" classification.  These are collected by the Government, Economics, and Sociology Bibliographer and by the Collection Development Librarian in the ILR Library.
