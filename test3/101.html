<p><strong><font size="4">South Asia </font></strong></p>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> </p>
<p>The South Asia collection serves the needs of the faculty and students of the 
  Cornell's South Asia Program and interdisciplinary courses offered. These courses 
  vary from beginning undergraduate to postdoctoral research. </p>
<p><strong>Background information:</strong> </p>
<p>South Asia consists of India, Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka (Ceylon) and Bangladesh 
  together with the Himalayan State of Sikkim. In the spring of 1858, President 
  Andrew D. White went to Europe armed with formidable lists of books and apparatus 
  to be collected. One of the most important of his acquisitions was the library 
  of Franz Bopp (1791-1867), the famous German Sanskritist and philologist. Forty 
  percent of this collection was on South Asia. </p>
<p> When the United States entered World War II, the academic community was suddenly 
  brought face to face with the importance of South Asia. With large-scale federal 
  support, particularly under the National Defense Education Act of1958, the establishment 
  of the South Asia Language and Area Center brought about a program of South 
  Asia area studies. Thus federal funds, plus matching grants (from the Ford Foundation 
  in many cases) have been made available for acquisitions and servicing of the 
  South Asia Collection. Cornell's South Asia Program was founded in 1958. The 
  program holds National Resource Center designation. </p>
<p>In the 2002/2003 academic year, there were 184 courses taught in the South 
  Asia program, 40 of which were languages courses. There were 35 faculty, 112 
  graduate students and 280 undergraduate students. At the end of that academic 
  year, the degrees conferred were as follows: Doctorates 4, Masters 5, Bachelors 
  40.</p>
<p><strong>Collection Description:</strong></p>
<p>The present collection reflects the history of the program and the interests 
  of its faculty members. Languages and linguistics, anthropology, religion and 
  history are collected in depth. </p>
<p>In 1962 Cornell joined the Library of Congress's PL-480 Program (now the Special 
  Foreign Currency Program), a book acquisitions scheme designed by the federal 
  government to use surplus currencies for comprehensive coverage of current publishing 
  in the South Asia subcontinent. In 1971 the Library refined its coverage to 
  selective languages. As of August 1973 the South Asia collections have achieved 
  comprehensive coverage in English and basic coverage in the other languages 
  selected in 1971. Since 1998 after the PL-480 Program's end, acquisitions through 
  the Library of Congress Cooperative Acquisitions Program and purchases of publications 
  from South Asia, within the scope of the collection policy, an attempt is made 
  to obtain all major monographs and serials published in the rest of the world. 
</p>
<p>In 2003 the collection consisted of 308,124 volumes, 8,535 serials titles, 
  1,400 video/DVD titles, 2,124 sound recordings and cassettes and 23 newspapers. 
  Library resources that support South Asia are spread all over the campus. Humanities 
  and social sciences are housed in Kroch Library. Mann Library, ILR library (Ives 
  Hall), Music Library (Lincoln Hall), Fine Arts Library (Sibley Hall), etc. are 
  responsible for acquiring their own material. The South Asia Curator does all 
  selection of South Asia materials housed in the Kroch Library and works with 
  selectors from other campus libraries in the selection and acquisition of their 
  South Asia materials. </p>
<p>Languages that are supported at the South Asia Collection are: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Bengali (India & Bangladesh)</li> 
  <li> Hindi</li> 
  <li>Hindi Dialects: Pali, Prakrit, Rajastani, Sanskrit </li>
  <li>Nepali (India & Nepal) </li>
  <li>Sanskrit</li> 
  <li>Sinhalese </li>
<li>Tamil </li>
 <li> Urdu (India & Pakistan)</li> </ul>
 
 
<p><strong>Cooperative Arrangements: </strong></p>
<p>In addition to its participation in regional and national networks, Cornell 
  is a member of the South Asia Microform Project (SAMP) housed at the Center 
  for Research Libraries (CRL). CRL, which receives a full Special Foreign Currency 
  Program set of publications, is considered to be the backup repository of serials 
  for the Research Libraries Group (RLG). </p>
