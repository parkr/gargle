<P><H2>Iberian History</H2>

<P><B>Clientele: </B> 
<br>The primary clientele for the Iberian history collections are the faculty and students of the History Department.  The collections also support the research and teaching of students and scholars in Romance Studies and the Latin American Studies Program.

<P><B>Existing Collection:</B> ECS 3   LANGUAGE W

<P>Iberian history collections cover the early modern and modern periods, c.a., 1450-  .  Spanish history collections are stronger than their Portuguese counterparts.  Periodical literature concentrates on national, rather than regional, historical journals.

<P><B>Current Collecting: </B>CCI 3 	LANGUAGE W

<P>While representative works in Iberian history are collected across the board, current collecting has followed the recent florescence in the early modern and post Franco and Salazar periods.

<P><B>Subjects Covered:</B> History of Spain and Portugal. Principal LC classes DP 161-271(Spain), DP 580-680 (Portugal).

<P><B>Geographical Information: </B>
<br>As used here Iberia refers principally to the European nations of Spain and Portugal and secondarily to the Spanish and Portuguese colonial empires.

<P><B>Exclusions:</B> textbooks, newspapers (Iberian Newspapers are collected by the Western European Social Sciences Bibliographer), rare items, manuscript materials.

<P><I>Notes:
</I>	Medieval history of Iberia is collected by the Medieval Studies bibliographer; Islam in Iberia is shared between Iberian history, Medieval, and Islamic Middle East bibliographers; Portuguese Africa falls principally to the African Studies Bibliographer.  The Ibero-American Bibliographer collaborates on the development of collections that cover the Hispanic and Portuguese speaking worlds as a whole, e.g. comparative works, colonial literature.
