<h2>French and Italian Language and Literature</h2>
<p></p>
<strong>Clientele:</strong> <br>

Primarily the faculty in the French and Italian language and literature sections of Romance Studies. 
Other interested departments are Theatre Arts, Comparative Literature, and Women's Studies. 
<p></p>
<strong>Existing collection:</strong><br>
ECS Language W<br>

4 Romance Studies
<p></p> 
The collections are strongest overall in Romance Studies, especially linguistics. The Library also has 
a historical interest in Romansch. 
<p></p>
<strong>Current collection:</strong> 
<br>

4 Romance Studies
<p></p> 
Despite the overall rating of 3, the collections support research in the major areas taught at Cornell: 
the works of major authors, and contemporary critical theory. Most new critical editions are acquired, 
although secondary critical works are purchased more selectively. During the past two years, a core 
of contemporary critical journals has been added. Faculty interest in French-Canadian literature, 
Beur literature, and francophone literature generally has broadened the scope of selection in these 
areas. An attempt is made to acquire all significant works in critical theory, especially feminist 
criticism.
<p></p> 
<strong>Subjects covered:</strong> P, PB (Breton), PC, PQ, PN, GR
<br> 
Romance literature and Romance languages are well-covered, primarily because of standing orders for 
European monographic series. Other subjects are French language and literature, Italian language and 
literature, Provençal, Romansch, and Swiss and Belgian belles-lettres in French, and Breton among the 
Celtic languages.  Modern Greek literature is collected at a basic level, mostly in English and Greek. 
The Romance Studies bibliographer is also responsible for Beur literature by Algerians residing in 
France, for French-Canadian literature, and for the growing number of francophone materials published in France by residents of former French territories. 
<p></p>
<strong>Geographical information:</strong> 
<br>
The French and Italian-speaking world; responsibilities for Caribbean and Francophone Africa shared 
with Ibero-American and African Studies bibliographers, respectively. 25% of imprints Anglo-American; 
75% European 
<p></p>
<strong>Exclusions:</strong> Dissertations, textbooks, most reprints 
<p></p>
<strong>Notes:</strong> The Ibero-American Bibliographer selects materials on Iberian language and 
literature, except for medieval coverage.
