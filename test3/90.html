<h2>Medieval Studies</h2>

<B>Clientele:</B>

<br />At Cornell, Medieval Studies is an interdisciplinary program
that draws faculty, graduate students, and undergraduate students from many
departments: Classics, Comparative Literature, English, History, History of
Art, Modern Languages, German Literature, Romance Studies, Music, Asian
Studies, and Near Eastern Studies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"></span>

<p></p><B>Existing collection strength:</B> 4 (research level) Languages: W
(Wide variety of foreign language material in addition to English language
material.) 

<br />For collection development purposes, the term &quot;medieval
studies&quot; refers to the languages, literatures, history, culture, commerce,
social life and customs of Europe and the Byzantine Empire from the period of
the Great Migrations (ca. A. D. 300) to the Renaissance (beginning in Italy
1350, England, France, Germany and Austria ca. 1485, the Low Countries and
Scandinavia 1500-1550). Within this scope, materials that are interdisciplinary
or intra-national are purchased by the medieval studies selector while
materials specific to a particular nation are generally purchased by the
appropriate <a href="subject%20selector">subject selector</a> (http://www.library.cornell.edu/colldev/cdselectors1.html).


<p><B>Call number ranges covered by the medieval studies selector:</B> D 100-203 (general history), DF 500-649 (Byzantium), GT (manners and customs), CR (heraldry), Z 105-115 (paleography), BL 830-980 (history of European religion), CC (medieval archaeology) and multinational European literature & history as appropriate, H (social sciences) as appropriate.</p>



<p>Olin Library's special strength is in the area of Old
English literature (the purview of the <a
href="http://www.library.cornell.edu/colldev/cdselectors1.html">English literature
selector</a>), complementing the Icelandic Collection's level 5 holdings (the
purview of the <a
href="http://www.library.cornell.edu/colldev/cdselectors1.html">Icelandic
selector</a>). The special collections of Dante and Petrarch materials are
nationally known; materials for the history of Italy in the Middle Ages are also
strong (the purview of the <a
href="http://www.library.cornell.edu/colldev/cdselectors1.html">Italian
literature selector</a>). During the 1960's the Library purchased extensive
retrospective sets of serials, and standing orders were placed for nearly all
scholarly European monographic series and serials in the field of Medieval
Studies. </p>
