<H2><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" SRC="gr_ball.gif"><A NAME="Purpose">Purpose</A></H2>

<P>The purpose of this collection development policy is to provide a point of

reference about which choices concerning the addition of new publications to the

collection can be made.  The implementation of these guidelines is dependent on

the availability of financial resources and the recurrent funding provided by

the University.</P>

<P>Materials about the Middle East and Islam are acquired by Cornell University

Library on the basis of their relevance to the courses taught in the University

and to support various instructional and research programs. These programs vary

from beginning undergraduate courses to post-doctoral research. The programs

served by this collection include, but are not limited to, those in Government,

History, Linguistics, Sociology, Anthropology, Economics, and Near Eastern

Studies (NES).  </P>

Description</A> and General Collection Guidelines</H2>

<P>Selection responsibilities include both materials published in the Middle

East and materials published in Western Europe and the United States about the

Middle East and Islam. We collect both trade and scholarly materials, including

books, serials, government documents, audiovisual items, etc. The Library's

collection on the Middle East and Islam is currently estimated at over 80,000

titles, housed mainly in Olin Library. Materials selection is based on the

following criteria:</P>

<H3><I>1. Subject: </I></H3>

<P>The collection covers virtually all subjects relevant to the study of the

Middle East and Islam. Particular emphasis is placed on descriptive works,

historical travels, history, philosophy and literature of Arabic speaking

countries, including those in North Africa, religion (studies of the Koran and

Hadith and associated religious texts and commentaries), Islamic law (unrelated

to specific countries), Arabic literature, and political science*.  </P>

<P><EM>Exceptions:</EM> Not acquired or retained are materials in the

following subjects: --Art and architecture of Middle Eastern &amp; Muslim

countries; Law (country specific laws &amp; statutes, etc.); Music; Science and

technology;  Medicine; Children's books,  and textbooks . </P>

<P><I>*n.b.: Not all of these subjects are covered in every geographical area,

nor is each subject evenly represented within each subject area.</I></P>

<H3><I>2. Languages: </I> </H3>

<P>Material in Arabic and English are collected most heavily. Persian, Turkish

(Modern and Ottoman), French and German titles are acquired actively, but

selectively. Materials in Kurdish, Coptic, other Iranian and Turkic languages,

other modern Western languages, as well as in various vernacular or less common

languages are acquired as demand warrants.  Translations from other languages

into Middle Eastern languages are not acquired, except for occasional standard

literary works when deemed necessary. Hebrew script materials are collected by

the Judaica selector. English or French language fiction by North African or

other Arab authors is usually covered by the selectors of those languages

respectively. </P>

<H3><I>3. Geographic Area: </I></H3>

<P>For the purposes of Cornell Library's Middle East and Islamic Studies, the

geographic areas covered include: Mauritania, Morocco and the Western Sahara,

Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, the Sudan, Turkey, Cyprus, Syria, Lebanon,

Israel (Arabic materials only), Palestine, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, United

Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain, Oman, Yemen, Iraq, Iran, and Afghanistan.</P>

<P><EM>Historians, political scientists, and others have defined world regions

in terms such as race &amp; ethnicity, culture, language &amp; linguistics,

religion, historical unity, climatic similarity, and / or geographic

compactness. One of the first questions encountered by anyone who wants to study

the region is what the &quot;Middle East&quot; is, specifically what countries

it involves. There is, however, a lack of consensus on one single definition of

a region that after all stretches over three different continents; and people

even refer to it variously by such terms as &quot;Near East,&quot; &quot;Mideast&quot;

or &quot;Middle East.&quot; In modern times, the designation &quot;Middle East,&quot;

was applied by Westerners who viewed the area as midway between Europe and East

Asia, which they call the Far East. There is at least agreement over the view

that the Middle East is more than a mere geographical concept and that there are

compelling historical, cultural, religious, political, social, and economic

reasons for considering it as an entity apart. 

</EM></P>

<P><EM>It is not, for example, the land of the Arabs (millions of Turkic,

Indo-European, and Negroid peoples live in the region).  It is not even, as many

presuppose, the land of Islam (in terms of population and territorial size, the

largest Islamic countries are outside of the traditional boundaries of the

Middle East.  Indonesia, India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan all have larger Muslim

populations than any country in what we call the Middle East).  Historically

(most of Iberia was under Islamic control for the better part of 700 years, and

most of the Balkans for almost as long) neither Spain, Portugal or Roumania a

Middle Eastern country. Hence:</EM></P>

Palestine; Qatar; Saudi Arabia; Syria; Turkey ; United Arab Emirates (federation

comprised of seven sheikdoms:  Ajman, Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Fujairah, Ras

al-Khaimah, Sharjah, and Umm al-Qawain); Yemen</EM></P>

<P><EM><STRONG><SMALL><U>The Periphery</U></SMALL></STRONG></EM></P>

<P><EM>.The Caucusus:  Armenia, Azerbaijan,  Georgia; </EM></P>

<P><EM>.Central Asia:  Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan,Tajikistan, Turkmenistan,

Uzbekistan</EM></P>

<P><EM>.Cyprus</EM></P>

<P><EM>.Horn of Africa:  Djibouti, Eritrea, Somalia, Zanzibar (now part of

Tanzania)</EM></P>

<P><EM>.Maghreb:  Algeria, Libya, Morocco &amp; the Western Sahara, Tunisia</EM></P>

<P><EM>.Sahel &amp; Sudan:  Chad, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Sudan</EM></P>

<P><EM>.South Asia:  Afghanistan, Pakistan</EM></P>

<H3><I>4.  Chronological Limits:</I> </H3>

<P>Emphasis is primarily on the Islamic period, i.e., from the 6th century A.D.

onward (the &quot;classical&quot; Arab-Islamic and modern Middle East).

Materials about the pre-Islamic Middle East are also collected by the library in

the areas of classics, archaeology, and fine arts. There is no limitation as to

the date of publication of items collected, although emphasis is on current

publications.  

</P>

<H3><I>5. General Considerations</I>: </H3>

<P>The lack of regular national bibliographies for many of the countries

covered, and the unorganized book trade, is compensated for through our

participation in the Middle East Cooperative Acquisitions Program of the Library

of Congress (MECAP). Further selection of individual titles in the vernacular is

based on dealers' lists, and a small percentage comes as gifts or on exchange.

Emphasis is on current materials. Manuscripts and theses and dissertations from

other universitites are preferably acquired in microform, when requested.

Audiovisual materials and other formats are collected selectively. Important

current Middle Eastern newspapers and magazines are acquired through direct air

mail subscription or through the Library of Congress Cairo office. For practical

purposes the following issues are observed when making decisions related to

materials selection and acquisitions: 

</P>

<P>a. Procedure: </P>

<P>All purchases with library funds are made by the acquisitions and serials

departments through which all requests for purchase pass. 

</P>

<P>b. Serials: </P>

<P>A serial is a publication issued in successive parts bearing numerical or

chronological designations and intended to be continued indefenitely. Serials

include periodicals, newspapers, annuals, and journals. Selection of serial

titles is based on the same criteria as monographs. Serial titles are reviewed

every four years for continued appropriateness to the curriculum. Serials are

purchased in microform under the following circumstances:</P>  

<P>1. Poor condition of existing copy or lack of availability of hard 		   

copy</P>

<P>2. Space restrictions.</P>

<P>3. Projected use</P>

<P>c. Editions and translations:</P>

<P>When several editions of a work are available, decisions are based on

format, editor, and date. New editions, including translations, are purchased

when they substantially update or improve on previous ones.</P>

<P>d. Replacement:</P>

<P>Materials withdrawn are not automatically replaced. Replacement depends on

the number of copies held by the library, existence of similar material in the

collection, potential use, etc.</P>

<P>e. Multiple copies:</P>

<P>Additional copies will be purchased for use as part of the general

collection only when justified by the significance of the material involved and

program enrollment. 

</P>

<P>f. Non-Library purchases:</P>

<P>Materials for collections outside the library's jurisdiction and management,

and materials needed in campus offices and classrooms, are not purchased with

library funds. 

</P>

<P>g. Gifts:</P>

<P>Gifts may be accepted on the condition that the library be permitted to

dispose of them or add them to the collection at its discretion.</P>

<P>h. Weeding:</P>

<P>When evaluating an item for possible removal, the essential issue is whether

the item has significant potential for use by the Cornell community. If an item

is judged not to have such potential, it should be removed to make room for

resources that do.</P>

</A></H2>

<P>Literature output from and about the countries of the Middle East and North

Africa is disproportionate from one country to the other. Egypt, Lebanon, Syria,

Iraq, and Iran are among the more actively represented. In our selection

endeavor we attempt to cover as many areas as necessary, attempting as balanced

coverage as possible within the confines of the budget. Our increased

participation in the<A

HREF="http://www.lib.virginia.edu/subjects/selection/lcovop/lcovop.html">

Library of Congress Middle East Cooperative Acquisitions Program </A>has allowed

us to consolidate our coverage in several areas and expand into new other ones. 

	Over the last few years, the Cornell Middle East and Islamica collection

improved substantially in quality and quantity. The following evaluations, based

on the subject breakdown of LC classification system and by country, are limited

to the major areas of the collection as disscussed above.
