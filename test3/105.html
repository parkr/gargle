            <p align="left"><strong>Introduction<br />
            </strong>Publishing is both a model and a method, an art and 
                  a craft, for making an information asset publicly or generally known, 
                  of declaring or reporting openly, to place before or offer to the 
                  public <a href="#footnote">[1]</a>.</p>
                <p>It is generally understood that the complex process 
                  of publishing a scholarly work involves a suite of interdependent 
                  activities:</p>
             
      <ul>
              <li> 
                <strong>Acquisition</strong>: the identification 
                    and evaluation of intellectually and financially viable properties, 
                    the peer reviewing of these projects, the negotiation of rights 
                    with property owners, and the cultivation and management of relationships 
                    with authors, editors, and stakeholders.
              </li>
              <li> 
                <strong>Development</strong>: editorial intervention 
                    to add structural and grammatical value to a work.
              </li>
              <li> 
                <strong>Design</strong>: the transformation of 
                    text and graphical material into aesthetically satisfy works on 
                    paper and on-line through an understanding of the principles of 
                    visual communications (typography and graphic architecture).
              </li>
              <li> 
                <strong>Production</strong>: the manufacturing 
                    of a work on paper, or on line.
              </li>
              <li>

                    research, development and execution of cost-effective campaigns

                  at Cornell University </strong><br />
              Technical innovations and economic pressures still cast a long
              shadow over the scholarly publishing community. Readers&#8217; and users&#8217; appetites
                  have become more sophisticated while the cost structures for
                  managing and delivering book and especially journal content electronically
                have become far more complex.</p>

          <p align="left"><strong>Project Euclid</strong><br />
            Five years ago, the Cornell University Library submitted a proposal
              to the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to support the design and
              deployment of a mechanism and environment for the on-line distribution
              of serial literature in mathematics and statistics. That initiative &#8212; 
            <a href="http://projecteuclid.org" target="_blank">Project Euclid</a> &#8212; was 
                funded in 2000 and launched as a multi-model publishing service 
                in early 2003. Today Euclid, the flagship product of the Library&#8217;s
                Electronic Publishing Program, delivers nearly 40 journals to libraries
                and individuals via subscription or open access.</p>
              <p align="left">Project Euclid is a novel and influential contribution 
                to the debate about the future of scholarly communications. The 
                Euclid model offers a remedial and sustainable prototype for how 
                serial literature for academic communities of common practice can 
                be enriched and delivered cost-effectively.</p>

            <blockquote> 
              <div align="left"><em>&quot;SPARC has had the opportunity to work closely 
                with Cornell&#8217;s Project Euclid team since the earliest stages. 
                I know first-hand of their commitment to serving the needs of 
                libraries and scholars. I am confident that Project Euclid will 
                reflect the best practices and policies of SPARC and its publishing 
                partners, with our shared mission of 'Returning Scholarship to 
                Scholars.'&quot;</em><br />

                Building on the success of Project Euclid, the Library is undertaking 
                an equally ambitious project to enhance and extend the software 
                system originally developed to deliver journal content from the 
                Project Euclid publishers. Digital Publishing Systems and Services 
                (DPubS) will provide authors, editors, and publishers with a more 
                cost-effective way to capture, transform, distribute, and archive 
              digital scholarly research. </p>                <p align="left">The enhancement of the DPubS platform, which supports 
                  Project Euclid, will include the following developments:</p>                <ul>
