<h2>Philosophy</h2>
</p>

<p>
<b>Clientele:</b><br>
The philosophy collection is used primarily by those members of the Cornell community taking 
courses in the Philosophy Department, and faculty and graduate students of the Department of 
Philosophy. The collection also supports philosophical aspects of other fields, such as classics, 
history, law, political science, literary criticism, art history, linguistics, the professions, 
women's studies, medieval studies, mathematics, and the sciences.  Several Cornell scholars are 
doing their principal work in philosophy outside the Philosophy Department, notably German Studies, 
Classics, and the Society for the Humanities.
</p>

<p>
<b>Existing Collection Strength:</b> ECS: 4; Language: W<br>
The collection emphasizes Anglo-American, French, German and other Continental philosophers, 
Classical and Medieval philosophy, and the philosophy of science. We offer substantial 
holdings of works by and about many of the Western philosophers. Some subjects are also 
supported by other libraries, e.g. Math (symbolic logic); Mann (ethical treatment of animals 
and the environment); law and Management (professional ethics).
</p>

<p>
<b>Current Collecting:</b> CCI: 3; Language: W<br>
Primarily analytical philosophy, critiques of the major thinkers, historical schools, logic, 
ethics, bioethics, aesthetics, philosophy of science.  Latin American and African philosophy 
are collected at 2-3 level.  Russian/Soviet, Islamic, and Jewish philosophy are generally 
upported by area selectors.  Philosophies of Asian origin are not supported by Asian collections, 
except in certain international areas such as yoga.  Etiquette and "conduct of life" are not 
collected.  Esoterica and occult topics are collected at 1-2 level, chiefly when the material 
is historical or has a philosophical approach (e.g.) hermeticism, alchemy).  Expenditures tend 
to be equally divided among serials, monographic series, and other monographic purchases.
