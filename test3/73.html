<h2>French History</h2>

<strong>Clientele:</strong> The primary clientele for the French History collection is the faculty and 
students (graduate and undergraduate) in the History Department. Scholars in French Literature also 
have an interest. 
<p></p>
<strong>Existing Collection:</strong> ECS 4; LANGUAGE W <br>
The collection covers all aspects of French History from 800 to the present. It is particularly strong
 for the period of the French Revolution and the Eighteenth Century. The book collection complements 
 the very strong Cornell collection of rare books and manuscripts pertaining to the French Revolution. 
<p></p>
<strong>Current Collecting:</strong> CCI 4; LANGUAGE W
<br>
 I continue to collect at a research level for all periods of French History from 800  to the present.
 The period before 800 is covered by the Medieval Bibliographer and the Classical and Ancient selector. A strong emphasis is placed on the Eighteenth Century and the French Revolution (which is collected at a 4+ intensity). Other areas of concentration include the era of Louis XIV, the various revolutions of the first half of the Nineteenth Century, and Franco-Prussian War and the Commune, the Dreyfus Case, France's participation in World War I, the occupation during World War II, and the DeGaulle era. Major national historical journals are subscribed to, as are a number of periodicals dealing with the history of regions. Local histories of only the major cities are collected. Large micro-form sets are generally not purchased using this fund. 
<p></p>
<strong>Subjects Covered:</strong> LC classes DC, DQ, and DH 401-811
<p></p>
<strong>Geographical Information:</strong> There is no limit on the geographical location of imprints, although most 
items tend to be published in France, England, or the United States.
