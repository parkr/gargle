<H2><P>Slavic and East European Studies</H2>


<P><B>Clientele:</B>
	<br>The Slavic and East European Program (SEEP) offers courses at the
	undergraduate and graduate levels.  Within this program are twenty-nine
	faculty members involved in research and instruction.  The Slavic
	collection also supports the research of numerous postdoctoral students and
	visiting scholars from all over the world.  Faculty members of SEEP teach
	within their own departments and also teach interdisciplinary courses in
	many different departments and schools at Cornell University. During the
	1992/93 academic year  the SEEP offered 222 courses (ranging from the 100
	to the 700 level) within sixteen schools and departments of Cornell
	University. 	The Slavic collection serves primarily, but not
	exclusively, the following departments:  Russian Literature, Comparative
	Literature, History, Government, Economics, Modern Languages and
	Linguistics, Sociology, Anthropology, Art, Architecture, City and Regional
	Planning, and Music.

<P><B>History of the Collection:</B>
	<br>Cornell's Slavic collection began with the gifts of Andrew Dickson
	White, 	the University's first president, and Eugene Shuyler, both of whom
	were American diplomats to Russia in the late nineteenth century.  The
	Russian collection took on greater significance during World War II when
	Cornell became a major center for U. S. Army training programs. 
	Substantial funding from the Ford Foundation in the 1960's enabled the
	Cornell University Library to upgrade the Russian collection and expanded
	its scope to include East Europe. In the past, the majority of the
	Library's materials in indigenous East European languages were acquired
	through extensive exchange programs with the major libraries of the Soviet
	Union and the Eastern Bloc. Since the collapse of the communist system and
	the failure of virtually all Eastern European book distribution channels,
	many comprehensive approval plans with new Western dealers have been
	instituted.  In 1989 a Soviet and East European Program (now Slavic and
	East European Program) evolved from the Soviet and Russian Studies
	Committee.  The sudden widening of East European Studies has created
	greater demands for more comprehensive and in-depth collections from and
	about countries of the former Soviet Bloc.  This demand is being met with a
	combination of exchange and approval plans now in place.  The most
	significant aspect of post-Soviet reality is the replacement of eight
	states 	with twenty-eight, all of them little known to both student and
	faculty scholars. 	Cornell University's traditional broad-based,
	interdisciplinary approach to area studies demands extending that approach
	to the new states.  A new research agenda requires a great depth and
	breadth of library collections.  Providing materials for studying and
	understanding the history, politics, economics, and culture of the region
	is a major challenge.  The Library is meeting this challenge with on
	increased materials budget and a completely new acquisition scheme.

	level of supporting instruction to full strength research collections.
